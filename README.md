# STA 141B Final

## Demo Link Coming Soon 

## This Shiny app takes advantage of the TheMealDB API and TheCocktailDB API.
You're able to search for a meal Id by category or area then search for the meal ID to get a YouTube tutorial or recipe source to make it at home.  

You can also just search for a random meal. If the API does not contain a tutorial, it is still a great tool for referencing and choosing a meal.  

For a drink / cocktail, you're able to search for an ID by a category or ingredient, then enter the ID to find the drink name, serving glass, and instructions.   

Disclaimer: I didn't make the database and not responsible for cocktail names (see Other/Unknown category for a laugh). 

The Apis can be found here: https://www.themealdb.com/api.php https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php

## Challenging and enjoyable parts of the project

This was challenging because I had to learn a completely new framework and work in a statistical language, R, that isn't tradionally used for web development.  

I'm amazed at how far you can push DOM manipulation and create a site without having to learn 3 different languages (HTML, CSS, JS). However, after learning the Shiny framework I have a new appreciation for front-end development and will never take Bootstrap/React for granted ever again... I'm really amazed that these two panels took almost 400 lines of code.  

The main code can be found in the `Final` folder. I had another panel for the Riot Games API, but unforunately it had no place here; you can see the finished, but unused source code in the other shiny app folders.

## Why I chose these APIs
Since this was an individual project instead of a group project, I embraced the freedom given and added all the APIs that interested me. I enjoy cooking, but am often as a loss at what to cook; this API allows me to easily pick a dinner with a drink on the side.
